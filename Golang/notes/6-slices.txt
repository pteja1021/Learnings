Slice are a projection of an array 
Declaration :

a := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
len(a) --> gives 3
cap(a) --> gives capacity of a i.e the limit which it can hold 

By default slices are passed by references 

b:= a[:]
c:= a[3:]
d:= a[:4]
e:= a[3:6]

All the above are passed by reference 

we can also use 'make' function to create slices 
We can add and remove elements to slices and arrays . However if we try to increase capacity of array beyond capacity,
the array gets copied into whole new array with new capacity. This can be costly if we are working with large arrays.

syntax : make([]int, length, capacity) -- the length is the current length , capacity is the actual number of elements it can hold
