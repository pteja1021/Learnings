These modifications are called as migrations 

--> adding fields
add the field to struct
use AutoMigrate method instead of Create 
This will automatically compare the fields and add new fields if any are found 

--> adding indexes
add the index as sql tag in your struct 
`sql:"index:name_of_the_index"`
call AutoMigrate method again,gorm will compare and add the index 

--> removing entities
use DropTableIfExists("name_of_the_table_in_db") for the entity you want to remove 
use AutoMigrate for other tables referencing it

--> changing the data field type 
modify the field's type in your struct , however AutoMigrate wont work since gorm wont work with non-datasafe migration 
use ModifyColumn method on db - was not properly coded by developers, use exec with raw sql if it doesnt work 

--> dropping the fields 
AutoMigrate wont work since it is not a data safe operation 
remove the fields from struct 
use DropColumn("name_of_the_field_in_db") on db
