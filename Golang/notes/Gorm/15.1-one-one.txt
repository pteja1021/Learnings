relation_name referencing_table

in both struct declaration

ex:

type User struct {
    gorm.Model 
    username string 
    Calendar Calendar
}

type Calendar struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name string 
    UserID uint // this is the field of User. The prefix "User" is what makes gorm recognize that this is a User struct's field 
}

adding a foreign key : db.Model(&Calendar{}).AddForeignKey(src,destination, on delete,on update)
the src is the field of the calendar table , destination is the field which calendar is referencing to
on delete - the operation we want to do- feasible values are "CASCADE"
similarly on update 

OR 

type User struct {
    gorm.Model 
    username string 
    Calendar Calendar
    CalendarID uint 
}

type Calendar struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name string 
}
