to ensure atomicity , changes to datbase are performed as transactions 

to do so, first create a  transaction object 

tx := db.Begin()

Now to make any change to datbase, perform them via this tx object and commit them 

if err = tx.Create(&u).Error ; err!=nil {
    tx.Rollback() // this will rollback in case the transaction fails or an error pops up
}

tx.Commit()
