They provide the notion of classes. Inheritance is not supported but can use composition viaq embedding

type Animal struct {
    Name string 
    Origin string 
}

type Bird struct {
    Animal // this is called as embedding Animal inside Bird - composition (bird has animal)
    FlySpeed int 
}

func main(){
    b := Bird{}
    b.Name = "emu"
    b.Origin = "australia"
    b.FlySpeed =20 
}
or
func main (){
    b := Bird {
        Animal : Animal{Name : "emu",Origin : "australia"}
        FlySpeed : 28
    }
}

To define methods on structs 
type greeter struct {
    greeting string
    name string 
}

func (g greeter) greet(){ // the g greeter provides the context and thus this is treated as a method . g is passed by value 
    fmt.Println(g.greeting,g.name )
}
