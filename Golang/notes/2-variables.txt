Declaration :
Three ways

1.var a int
a=23

2. var a int =42

3. a :=42 (not allowed at package level)

We cant redeclare a variable but can shadow them 
All variables must be used , else it throws error at compile time itself

Use strconv package to cast "int" to "string"
No implicit conversion in GO
