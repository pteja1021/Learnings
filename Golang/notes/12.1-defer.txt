the defer keyword is used to not execute that particular line of code . It is deferred until the end of that function
Just before that function returns, all the defer statements are run. The defer uses a Stack like structure to store the statements to run 
Hence the statements are run in LIFO order 

example :
func main(){
    defer fmt.Println("first")
    defer fmt.Println("middle")
    defer fmt.Println("end")
}

any variables that defer statement is using will be preserved with the value at that time. Any changes to variable after the 
defer statement will not be reflected

output : end middle first
