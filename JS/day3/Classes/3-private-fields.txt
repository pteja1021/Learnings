ES2022 allows to define private field of a class using # sign 
the private fields can be accessed only inside the class and invisible to outside of class

example:
class Circle {
  #radius = 0; // # is the private field 
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
  get area() {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
  }
  set radius(value) {
    if (typeof value === 'number' && value > 0) {
      this.#radius = value; //the private fields can be accessed by the # sign
    } else {
      throw 'The radius must be a positive number';
    }
  }
  get radius() {
    return this.#radius;
  }
}

private fields are not accessible even in child classes

To check if an object has a private field inside a class , use the 'in' operator

fieldName in objectName

To create private methods.
class MyClass {
  #privateMethod() {
    //...
  }
}
Private methods can be called inside the class but can neither be called outside the class nor in subclasses.
