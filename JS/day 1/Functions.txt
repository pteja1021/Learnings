1. Function declaration
the identifier is given after keyword,
it is hoisted

Function EXPRESSION
identifier is declared as a variable
it is not hoisted

2. const <identifier>= (param1,param2..)=>{
    <body>
}
if there is only one parameter, no need of parenthesis
if there is only one line of body, no need of curly braces and 
that line is returned by default. Hence no return keyword is required

3. function adder(number1,number2){
    return number1+number2;
}

4. const multiplier=function(number1,number2){
    return number1*number2;
}

5. const subtractor = (number1, number2) => number1-number2;
