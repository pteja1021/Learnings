function <identifier>(p1=default1,p2,p3..){
    <function body>
}

the function keyword, identifier, body all put together
form the function declaration.

hoisting - function can be called before even it is declared.
AVOID HOISTING.

FUNCTION EXPRESSION
const <identifier>=function(p1,p2){
    ....
    return ...
}
A function with no name is called an ANONYMOUS FUNCTION.
Hence RHS of function EXPRESSION is an anonymous function.
To invoke an EXPRESSION:
<identifier>(arg1,arg2)

function EXPRESSIONs cannot be hoisted.

ARROW FUNCTION
const <identifier>=(p1,p2..)=>{
    ...
    return ...
}
for single parameter, we dont need brackets in arrow function declaration.
however for zero or >1 , we need them.
arrow functions are not hoisted

Also, a function with body of single line does not need curly braces.
that single line will directly be returned, hence no return keyword is needed.
