A variable is basically a container for a value
declare variables using 'var' keyword. camel casing is the standard.
Rules:
	1. cannot start with numbers
	2. case-sensitive
	3. cannot be the keywords
ES6 introduced the 'let' keyword. Both let and var keywords can be used to delcare variables. One need not assign a value at the beginnning itslef. if such initialisation is not given then the variable assumes a value of undefined.
ES6 also introduced the 'const' keyword. These variables cant be reassigned.Trying to do so will result in TypeError.
Mathematic assignment operators : +=. -=, *=, /=, ++, --
String Interpolation : these are called template literals
use backticks and to use variables inside a string, use ${<variable>}
the ${} is called placeholder

typeof operator
usage : typeof <variable>
