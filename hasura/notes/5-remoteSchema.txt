for remote schemas we create a whole new apollo server which has custom resolvers to queries 
This apollo server is deployed to any public DNS 

The same URL is used in remote schemas

Now if we query on graphql api, the same query to which we have written resolver will work 
Hasura will merge the custom graph ql schema with already existing auto generated APIs over postgres
