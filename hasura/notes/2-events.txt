events act like triggers
we are supposed to give an endpoint to which hasura makes a POST request

We can configure when this endpoint is supposed to be hit- maybe like an insert or update or delete on some table in database
We can write our custom business logic there

Hence we need to write a separate REST API
The variables and related info can be accessed completely using the req object inside the node server
