Hasura is designed in a way so that it doesnt have to deal with Authentication directly itself

It can be made to consume token from an external identity provider - this is where auth0 is coming in- it is an identity provider 

Users are made to login through any client provider like firebase or auth0
After loggin in, the payload that is further sent is modified. We add jwt hasura claims which has mainly 3 extra fields
1. x-hasura-user-id
2. x-hasura-user-role 
3. x-hasura-allowed-rules 

The entire payload is encoded into a jwt token and then sent to next handler
