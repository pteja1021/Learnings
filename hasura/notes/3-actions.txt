these work similar to event triggers 

Actions are custom queries or mutations that are resolved via HTTP handlers to which a POST request is sent. 
Actions can be used to carry out complex data validations, data enrichment from external sources 
or execute just about any custom business logic.

However actions are defined to add a new query/mutation- similar to a function. They are invoked only when called.
Syntax wise - we are required to return a new struct which can be returned. We are not allowed to return a primary type 
directly while writing an action 

Events are run in response to a particular trigger like an insert/update/delete on columns in a table of database
